# Developer Mindset
 After I read [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/), I learned alot of things,

 First of all, as a developer you have to stay positive and don't let anyone break your spirits.

As a developer you have to:

1. Specify your goal of the software.

2. Set priorities.

3. Be creative.
4. Make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.

5. Think about future maintenance. 

6. keep learning. 

7. Think before acting.

8.  Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them.
